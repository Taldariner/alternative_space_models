# Research on Non-Standard Space Models in Computer Simulation

This repository contains code for a thesis project titled "Research on Non-Standard Space Models in Computer Simulation."

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to explore and simulate physics effects in non-standard space models using Godot's capabilities for visualization and simulation. These simulations will provide a deeper understanding of the properties of various space types and their interaction with objects in a virtual environment.

## Requirements

### For Godot Engine version:

- [Godot Engine 4.0+](https://godotengine.org/download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Taldariner/alternative_space_models.git
cd alternative_space_models
```

### 2.1. To run Godot Engine version

1. Open the Godot Engine.
2. Click **"Import"** and navigate to the folder **you_repository_folder/Godot/**.
3. Select the **project.godot** file and click **"Open"**.
4. After importing, click **"Play"** or press the **F5** key to start the simulation.

## Contributing

1. **Fork the repository.**
2. **Create a new branch:**
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
3. **Make your changes and commit them:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m 'Add some feature'
    ```
4. **Push to the branch:**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
5. **Create a new Pull Request.**
